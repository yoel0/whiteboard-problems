CHALLENGE PROBLEM 1:   ðŸ¦ˆ SHARK TALE!ðŸ¦ˆ
***
Your friend invites you out to a cool floating pontoon around 1km off the beach. Among other things, the pontoon has a huge slide that drops you out right into the ocean, a small way from a set of stairs used to climb out.
---
As you plunge out of the slide into the water, you see a shark hovering in the darkness under the pontoon... Crap!
---
You need to work out if the shark will get to you before you can get to the pontoon. To make it easier... as you do the mental calculations in the water you either freeze when you realise you are dead, or swim when you realise you can make it!
---
You are given 5 variables;
---
```python
sharkDistance = distance from the shark to the pontoon.
```
``` 
The shark will eat you if it reaches you before you escape to the pontoon.
```
```python
sharkSpeed = how fast it can move in metres/second.
```
```python
pontoonDistance = how far you need to swim to safety in metres.
```
```python
youSpeed = how fast you can swim in metres/second.
```
```python
dolphin = a boolean, if true, you can half the swimming speed of the shark as the dolphin will attack it.
```
```
The pontoon, you, and the shark are all aligned in one dimension.
If you make it, return "Alive!", if not, return "Shark Bait!".
```
# Example Function and Test Cases below:
```python
def shark(pontoon_distance, shark_distance, you_speed, shark_speed, dolphin):
    pass # Don't get eaten!
```
```python
(shark(12, 50, 4, 8, True) 
# should return "Alive!"

(shark(7, 55, 4, 16, True)
# should return "Alive!"

(shark(24, 0, 4, 8, True)
# should return "Shark Bait!"
```

CHALLENGE PROBLEM 2: ðŸ§® ALL POSSIBLE SUMS ðŸ§®
***
Given a long number, return all the possible sum of each two digits within the number as a list.
For example, 12345:
all possible sum of each two digits from that number are:
```
[ 1 + 2, 1 + 3, 1 + 4, 1 + 5, 2 + 3, 2 + 4, 2 + 5, 3 + 4, 3 + 5, 4 + 5 ]
```
Therefore the result must be:
```
[ 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9 ]
```
# Example Function and Test Cases Below:
```python
def digits(num):
    return ???
digits(156)
# should return [ 6, 7, 11 ]
digits(81596)
# should return [ 9, 13, 17, 14, 6, 10, 7, 14, 11, 15 ]
digits(3852)
# should return [ 11, 8, 5, 13, 10, 7 ]
digits(3264128)
# should return [ 5, 9, 7, 4, 5, 11, 8, 6, 3, 4, 10, 10, 7, 8, 14, 5, 6, 12, 3, 9, 10 ]
digits(999999)
# should return [ 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18 ]
```
